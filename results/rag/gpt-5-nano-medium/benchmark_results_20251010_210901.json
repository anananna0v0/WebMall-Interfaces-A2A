It starts with a brand-new 45MP sensor that is back illuminated and stacked for blazingly fast read-out speeds that allow for a 30 fps electronic shutter, then builds on that with major focus improvements, increased video capabilities, and so much more.nDIGIC AcceleratorThe DIGIC Accelerator chip is a completely new front-end processor developed by Canon to supplement the power of the proven DIGIC X processor. The DIGIC Accelerator handles the processing that makes so many of the new features of this camera possible, allowing the DIGIC X chip to focus solely on image processing, again contributing to incredible speed. The DIGIC Accelerator processes large volumes of data directly from the image sensor for actions like AF detection to exposure metering calculations that enable eye-control focus, subject identification and tracking, and even deep learning with features like neural upscaling and noise reduction.nTotally new SensorEven though the pixel count is the same as the EOS R5, this is a completely new 45MP sensor design. This new full-frame sensor is stacked and back-illuminated allowing for incredible electronic shutter performance of 30 fps RAW or full-resolution JPEG still images. Sensor read-out speeds are dramatically increased, significantly reducing rolling shutter distortion. Pre-continuous shooting is now possible in electronic shutter mode, when the shutter is pressed halfway the camera begins capturing images, and when fully pressed, the previous \\u00bd-second of images are written to the memory card.nTime to focusAutofocus has been significantly updated on the EOS R5 Mark II with features like subject tracking which it shares with the new flagship EOS R1. Subject tracking allows you to maintain focus on a subject even when they are obscured briefly while shooting. And, for even faster positioning of your active AF Area, the R5 Mark II adds Canon\\u2019s EyenControl AF \\u2013 even more advanced than the Eye Control in the EOS R3 camera. Once you calibrate the viewfinder to your eye, just look where you want to focus, and the AF Area will move there when you press the AF activation button.nAction priorityThanks again to the increased camera processing power of the DIGIC Accelerator chip, we have developed a new AF mode called Action priority. This new focusing technology selects subjects according to movement and other factors so you always get a great action shot! This feature works with three sports at the moment, soccer, volleyball, and basketball. With Action priority the camera can recognize and track specific people, and takes into account ball tracking, movement tracking, eye-control AF and more to help ensure you get the action shot you want when everything is moving so fast.nGet CinematicWith its 45MP sensor, 8K video up to 60 frames per second can be recorded internally, to the camera\\u2019s CFexpress card (sold separately). A new menu now includes Cinema EOSterminology, making it even easier for users to access and understand the video features of this camera, and be easily integrated into video productions where Cinema EOS cameras may be used like the EOS C70 or EOS C400. RAW video can be recorded at 8K resolution, and there\\u2019s now an S-RAW setting for 4K RAW video recording. RAW video is now 14-bit recording, for even greater range of tonalities. For users who don\\u2019t need RAW video, MP4-type video can be recorded in a multitude of possible file types and resolutions, from Full HD (at up to 240 frames per second), 4K at up to 120 framesper second with sound and 8K. Any of the \\u201cFine\\u201d options record oversampled video, for even greater sharpness and detail. Canon Log 2 and C-Log 3 are available. And, the R5 Mark II adds features like a full-size HDMI port on the camera, Waveform monitors, and up to 24-bit, 4-channel audio recording.n\\nRelated Products\\nAbout Us\\nWe are passionate about bringing you innovative tech products that enhance your lifestyle.\\nShop\\nContact Us\\nHardware Cafe 1624 Circuit Blvd, Suite 5 Denver, CO 80203 United States\\n\\ud83d\\udcde +1 (129) 366-8351 \\u2709\\ufe0f support@hardwarecafe.com\\nGadget Store WordPress Theme By WP Radiant | Proudly powered by WordPress\"}]}",

Lightweight, high-strength 5052 aluminum alloy top case enables the slim, bladelike chassis. Underneath find mouse and headset cable management, plus adjustable-height feet with rubber stabilizers, for confidence during intense gameplay.\nADVANCED MECHANICAL Engineered to Outperform The Romer-G\u2122 mechanical switch is purpose-built for pro-grade performance, responsiveness and durability. The short-throw actuation at 1.5mm is 25% faster than the competition\u2019s standard mechanical switches. A perfect blend of speed, precision and quiet performance, Romer-G is the stealth assassin of mechanical gaming keyboard switches.\nPRECISION KEY LIGHTING Performance Day and Night Romer-G is also purpose-designed for precise and clean lighting through the keycap.
