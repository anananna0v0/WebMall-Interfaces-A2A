Webmall_Best_Fit_Specific_Task11,Webmall_Best_Fit_Specific,additional,"based on my analysis of the search results and product details, i found several fractal design pc gaming cases that meet your requirements for 240mm radiator support and 330mm gpu clearance. here are the qualifying models:

**cases that meet both requirements (240mm radiator + 330mm+ gpu support):**

1. **fractal design meshify 2 mini** - explicitly supports 331mm gpu & 280mm radiator (which includes 240mm)
2. **fractal design meshify 2 (standard e-atx models)** - support radiators up to 360mm front, 420mm top, 280mm base (includes 240mm), and based on e-atx specifications, should support gpus over 330mm
3. **fractal design meshify 2 xl** - supports radiators up to 480/420mm front, 480/420mm top, 280/240mm base, and being the xl version, has even more gpu clearance

the meshify 2 mini is specifically advertised with 331mm gpu support and 280mm radiator support, making it a perfect match. the standard meshify 2 and meshify 2 xl models support larger radiators (up to 360mm+ and 480mm+ respectively) which includes 240mm support, and as e-atx cases, they should easily accommodate gpus over 330mm in length.

Webmall_Find_Compatible_Products_Task4,Webmall_Find_Compatible_Products,additional,"based on my search and analysis, i found several excellent 32gb ddr5 ram options that are compatible with your asus rog strix z790-e gaming motherboard. the motherboard supports ddr5 memory with 4 dimm slots, so you have flexibility in choosing between single sticks, dual-channel kits, or even larger capacity options.

here are the compatible 32gb ddr5 ram kits i found:

**single 32gb sticks:**
1. **kingston fury beast 32gb ddr5-5600** - €129.99 (single stick, cl40, xmp 3.0)

**32gb kits (2x16gb):**
2. **team t-force vulcan 32gb kit (2x16gb) ddr5-6000** - €129.99 (cl38, xmp 3.0, black)
3. **corsair vengeance 32gb kit (2x16gb) ddr5-5600** - €129.99 (cl36, amd optimized)
